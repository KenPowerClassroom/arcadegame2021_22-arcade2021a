# Minimum Viable Product

## The base version of the game that is still enjoyable to the user will include the following
- The ability to swap out player pokemon
- Random enemy pokemon appearing out of the brushes
- Clicking on the enemy pokemon with the correct player pokemon to make them "faint"
- Player health visible on screen
- Enemy pokemon damaging player health if not attacked fast enough
- Basic sprites and background
- Ability to losE

## Out of scope
- Blood splatter for "fainting" pokemon
- Animations
- Title screen
- Sound effects
- Multiple pokemon coming out of the brushes
- Two player inputs
- Smart "AI"

## Stories for MVP
- As a user I want to see a visual representation of my attack going towards the enemy so that I can aim more easily
- As a user I want to be able to see my pokemon displayed so that I can have visual feedback when I swap
- As a developer I want to implement a random selection system for enemy pokemon to make the experience less repetitive for the user
- As a user I want to know when a pokemon is about to attack me so that I can get a sense of urgency to attack it back
- As a developer I want to implement an attacking system for the player so that they can damage the wild pokemon to progress the game
- As a user I want to know how much health I have so that I have an idea of how close I am to losing
- As a developer I want the player to be able to deal more damage to enemy pokemon if they use the correct type of poemon so that gameplay is more challenging
- As a user I would like pretty sprites and backgrounds because my eyes desire visual candy
- As a developer I want my players to be able to lose the game so that they can restart and have the chance to get a better score
